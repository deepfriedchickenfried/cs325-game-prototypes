<h2>Q F J P</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a somewhat unique multiplayer concept that only uses 1 button

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game uses Phaser's p2 physics instead of its Arcade physics and makes full use of collision groups.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>

I learned how to use p2 physics and that bodies made using arcade physics can't rotate.

The easiest part of making this game was the text and camera flash at the end of a round.

The hardest part of making this game was figuring out how to use the p2 physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Virtually all of my assets are made from scratch except for the music.
<ul>
<li>Out of Time by Abstration from the album Three red hearts prepare to dev: <a href="https://tallbeard.itch.io/three-red-hearts-prepare-to-dev">Three red hearts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Can't really think of a similar game. I guess it would be close to other top down multiplayer 1 button games. 
This time I didn't actually take any code from other games.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast pace 4 person multiplayer game where each must control a spinning character and try to stab the others.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I created a multiplayer game.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the movement of characters and the overall feel of the game.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I simply want players to have fun and feel a little challenged.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Takes around 5 minutes to play.

</li>
