<h2>Vomit Comet</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Top down puzzle game where you eat and shoot letters against a horde of enemies
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There are a lot of things going on but I think the coolest thing is that the player shoots the same letters that he gathers
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned that it is harder than it looks to make a top down shooter
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part of making this was getting the enemies to work right.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Box Jump by Abstraction from the album Three red hearts prepare to dev: <a href="https://tallbeard.itch.io/three-red-hearts-prepare-to-dev">Three red hearts</a></li>
</ul> Everything else is handcrafted beautiful pixel art that I did.(not really beautiful)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>All of the code I wrote myself.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Survive against hordes of enemies as you gather and shoot out letters.

</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I used was letters are returned.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing out the basic interactions and movement
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Want players to have fun as they try to survive as long as possible
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

The player can move with WASD, aim and fire with the mouse and suck up letters with space. The player can also hold shift while firing to rapidly increase their rate of fire. They cannot fire and gather letters at the same time. The goal of this game is to simply survive as long as possible. The vacuum power will make letters in a radius around the player go to him and disapear, turning into ammo.
As for future gameplay I would like to implement a variety of things such as more enemies, powerups and passive abilities.
I would also like to make the letters spawn from the enemies in the form of words and sound effects
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy will be to constantly move and gather letters while shooting the zombies closest to you.

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is a mysterious being that can suck up letters from speech and store them in his gun. He is being attacked by people that want him dead and he must live as long as possible.

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People that like top down shooters
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 5 minutes
</li>
