<h2>Vomit Comet version 2.0</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Top down puzzle game where, you are a parasitic organism that can explosively leave its host in order to infect another and must use that power to escape a lab before scientists can perform terrible experiments on you.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Making the player and the projectile bounce off the corner pieces were a pain
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
Figured out finally how to use tile maps and levels
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part of making this was getting the collisions and interactions to work properly
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>The loading screen and initial music is from the example
</ul> Everything else is handcrafted beautiful pixel art that I did.(not really beautiful)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>All of the code I wrote myself.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a parasitic organism that must leave a lab.

</li>


<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing out the basic interactions and movement
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Want players to have fun as they try to solve each puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

The player can move with up down left right. You start at the green person and can press in any direction and your goal is to reach the orange person. 
There are several different types of enemies.
The red enemies kill you if you touch them, but can be killed by the projectile.
The black enemies are normal and can be infected or killed with a projectile
The white enemies are light enemies that move one space when infected
The clear enemies are ghost enemies that disapear immediatly when infected

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy is to carefully plan out your intended moves before you launch yourself.

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of the game is that you are an intelligent parasite that was captured by scientists. They would constantly perform terrible experiments on you and so you have had enough and want to get revenge and escape. Eventually as they continue to perform experiments you learn that you can infect living organisms and then launch yourself from them. This does leave the hosts though very dead. You are very fragile though so if you get hit more than once when you are outside of the host you are dead for good. Luckily for you the scientists have stored a large amount of you and so you can try to escape for as long as you want.

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People that like top down puzzle games
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 5 minutes
</li>
